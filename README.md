# Mini-Forklift

The Miniature Forklift Project is a unique creation designed from scratch, featuring a 3D-printed miniature forklift capable of transporting and stacking small boxes. The forklift is controlled using an Xbox controller, providing an interactive and fun user experience.

Features:

1. Custom Design: The forklift is designed entirely from scratch, emphasizing a compact and functional design suitable for miniature operations.

2. Xbox Controller Interface: Users can control the forklift's movements using an Xbox controller, offering precise and intuitive control over its operations.

3. Transport and Stack: The forklift is capable of transporting and stacking small boxes, showcasing its practicality and versatility.

Components Used:

1. Custom 3D-Printed Parts: The project utilizes self-designed 3D-printed components to create the forklift's structure and mechanisms.
2. WiFi Socket Connection: A WiFi socket connection is established between a laptop and an ESP-WiFi module, enabling wireless communication and control of the forklift.
3. Serial Connection to Activity Bot: The forklift is connected to an Activity Bot via a serial connection, facilitating data exchange and control commands.

How it Works:

1. The user controls the forklift's movements using an Xbox controller.
2. The control commands are transmitted wirelessly to the forklift via the WiFi socket connection.
3. The forklift's custom-designed 3D-printed parts enable it to transport and stack small boxes.
4. Serial communication between the forklift and the Activity Bot facilitates data exchange and coordination for enhanced functionality.
